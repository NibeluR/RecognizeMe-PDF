    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>What is this app?</li>
        <p>RecognizeMe is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) project which can recognize text from your images and convert them into PDF format</p>
        <li>What languages are supported?</li>
        <p>For now, this tool supports only English, Russian and Deutsch as recognition databases have large file sizes</p>
        <li>Can I use this for handwriting?</li>
        <p>Yes, but this tool is inconsistent for handwriting. Unless you handwrite like a typewriter ðŸ˜‚</p>
        <li>What files are supported?</li>
        <p>JPG, PNG, BMP, WebP. It is recommended to use JPG or PNG</p>
        <li>How does it work?</li>
        <p>You upload an image (5MB Max size) from your Explorer and this tool does the rest. The recognition may take some time depending on file size.<br> Once it finishes the process, you will be redirected to created PDF</p>
        <li>Can I improve text recognition results?</li>
        <p>Yes, but you'll need to improve the quality of the upload image for the best output results</p>
